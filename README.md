# apachetop.rs

This is a Rust reimplementation of my original project [ApacheTop](https://github.com/tessus/apachetop). Mainly it served as a Rust learning exercise during the COVID-19 lockdown.

This is unfinished. Basic functionality works but it's not as complete as the original yet.

Very quick rundown: while running, pressing o toggles between sort orders; pressing g toggles between grouping types. Press q to quit.
